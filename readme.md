The Ukrainian school library website is designed for online digitizing of materials.
Students can now easily access any issue of the school newspaper at any time. Students can also watch video clips from the school newspaper's press center.
In the future I might integrate a node framework to work with the database (for example, to make a system of reactions under the new issue - hearts). But it all rests on the possibilities of hosting and my skills, so for now it is not in my plans.
The site is still a little bit unfinished, in terms of, about to bring in the last issue, more videos, and redo small details.
