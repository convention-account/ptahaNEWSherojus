The Ukrainian school library website is designed for online digitizing of materials. Students can now easily access any issue of the school newspaper at any time. They can also watch video clips from the school newspaper's press center.

In the future, I might integrate a Node.js framework to work with the database (e.g., to add a reaction system, like hearts, under new issues). However, this depends on hosting capabilities and my skills, so it's not in the immediate plans.
